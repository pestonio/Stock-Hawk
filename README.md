# Stock-Hawk
Udacity ND Project

Allows users to get a list of companies listed on the US stock market via a Yahoo! API, view their current value, percentage or monetary changes, 
and a graph to demonstrate these changes over time.
Users can add or remove stocks to this list as required, and implement an app widget for quick reference.
